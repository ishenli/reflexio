# Extraction golden-set eval runner (AI-judged)

Scaffolding to score the **extractor** (profiles + playbooks) against curated
gold cases, and to catch regressions when the extraction prompts change.

It is **AI-judged** and **float-scored** — unlike consolidation decision evals
(which classify a decision into a discrete
kind), extraction quality is graded by an LLM judge on two continuous
dimensions. The judge, rubric, golden cases, and fixtures already exist; this
package adds the **runner** that wires them together (load → extract / supply →
judge → aggregate).

> **This is bounded scaffolding plus a tiny illustrative fixture, not a
> curated eval dataset.** The cases in
> `../golden_set/extraction/{dev,validation,holdout}/` exist
> only to exercise the harness end-to-end.

## What it reuses (not re-implemented here)

| Piece | Lives in | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLMJudge.score(*, expected, actual)` | `tests/eval/judge.py` | the shared judge — returns `JudgeScore{signal_f1, answer_correctness, grounded_rate, rationale}` |
| `extraction_rubric.yaml` | `tests/eval/judge_prompts/` | the extraction rubric (`{expected}` / `{actual}`) |
| golden cases | `tests/eval/golden_set/extraction/{dev,validation,holdout}/*.yaml` | `id`, `category`, `sessions`, `expected_profiles`, `expected_playbooks`, `must_NOT_include_profiles`, `notes_for_judge` |
| `extraction_case` / `extraction_judge` fixtures | `tests/eval/conftest.py` | parametrize over cases; provide a stub judge (or real LLM under `REFLEXIO_EVAL_REAL_JUDGE=1`) |

This package adds only `runner.py` (`run_eval` / `score_case` / `EvalResults` /
`CaseOutcome`) — it contains no scoring prompt of its own.

## Metrics

The judge scores each case on two dimensions in `[0, 1]`:

- **`signal_f1`** — did the extraction capture the expected *signals*, including
  nuance the case flags (TTL granularity, supersession, rationale detail)?
- **`grounded_rate`** — are the emitted items' `source_span`s genuinely verbatim
  in the session transcript (no hallucinated spans)?

(`answer_correctness` is a search-only dimension, pinned to 0 here and ignored.)

`EvalResults` aggregates per-case scores into:
- `signal_f1_mean`, `grounded_rate_mean` (arithmetic means; 0.0 when empty),
- `pass_rate(threshold=0.7)` — fraction of cases with `signal_f1 >= threshold`
  **and** `grounded_rate >= threshold`,
- `n`, and a `summary()` block.

There is **no kind label or confusion matrix** — extraction is graded, not
classified.

## Case splits

- `dev/`: prompt and validation work.
- `validation/`: candidate-version selection.
- `holdout/`: frozen final acceptance cases.

Each expected playbook should include `trigger`, `content`, and a verbatim
`source_span`. Cases may set `category` for later per-category reporting.

## Running

The default `extraction_judge` is stubbed, so the harness runs without
credentials:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/eval/extraction -o 'addopts=' -q
```

Set `REFLEXIO_EVAL_REAL_JUDGE=1` (with an API key) to score against a real LLM
judge. The `@skip_low_priority` `test_real_judge_smoke` (gated by
`RUN_LOW_PRIORITY=1`) exercises the live-judge path.

## Supplying extractions

`run_eval` takes either a parallel `extractions` list (precomputed
`(profiles, playbooks)` per case — the default tests use the case's own gold
items as a perfect-extraction baseline) or an `extraction_provider` callable. To
evaluate the **live extractor** end-to-end, use the provider in `providers.py`:

```python
from tests.eval.extraction.providers import make_extraction_provider

provider = make_extraction_provider(llm_client=real_client, request_context=ctx)
results = run_eval(cases=cases, extraction_provider=provider, judge=judge)
```

It wraps a case's `sessions` into a `RequestInteractionDataModel`, runs the real
`PlaybookExtractor` + `ProfileExtractor` (real prompts + LLM; storage is the
auto-wired temp SQLite in `request_context`, no seeding), and returns the
produced `(profiles, playbooks)`. This makes real LLM calls, so it lives behind
the `@skip_low_priority` smoke `test_live_extraction_provider_real` (run with
`RUN_LOW_PRIORITY=1` + an API key); a non-skipped mocked-seam test (patching
`litellm.completion`) covers the provider's construction in default CI. Produced
items may be `UserProfile` / `UserPlaybook` entities or plain dicts (a `_to_dict`
shim normalizes both for the judge).
