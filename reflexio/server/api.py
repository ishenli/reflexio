"""OSS FastAPI app composer (Tier3 A2).

``create_app`` is a thin composition root: it builds the FastAPI instance, wires
the five middleware (in order), registers the CORS + rate-limit + auth-override
seams, mounts the data-plane routers, and attaches the capability lifespan loop.

The data-plane handlers live in ``reflexio.server.routes.<domain>`` sub-routers.
``core_router`` aggregates every sub-router via ``include_router`` so it remains
the single data-plane router surface the enterprise composition mounts and
iterates (e.g. the QPS billable-endpoint scan over ``core_router.routes``).

``limiter`` / ``configure_rate_limiter`` are re-exported from
``reflexio.server.rate_limit`` and the middleware classes from
``reflexio.server.middleware`` for backwards-compatible imports.

        require_auth: When True, declares a Bearer security scheme in the OpenAPI spec

        get_caller_type: Custom dependency for classifying the caller (e.g., production
            agent vs dashboard).  When provided, overrides the default_get_caller_type
            dependency globally, exactly mirroring the get_org_id override.
        get_billing_gate: Optional factory ``(line: str) -> FastAPI dependency`` that
            replaces the default no-op gate for each billable billing line.  When
            provided, for every line used in the app (``"application"`` and

            exactly mirroring the ``get_caller_type`` override pattern.
        mount_data_plane: When True (default), include the data-plane routers
            (core, stall-state, pending-tool-call) and run the data-plane
            lifespan work (LLM availability check, cross-encoder prewarm,

            auth overrides, OpenAPI security, health, ``/meta/version``,
            ``additional_routers``).
        capabilities: Optional registry of enterprise capabilities. When provided,
            each capability's routers, services, hooks, and lifecycle methods are
            wired into the app at construction time. Behavior is unchanged when
            ``None``.
        app_context_factory: Optional callable returning the AppContext passed to
            each capability's on_startup. When None, an empty AppContext() is used
            (local OSS / tests). Enterprise binds this to supply self_host_org_id /
            activated computed during its own startup.
        profile: Optional declarative :class:`DeploymentProfile`. When None
            (default), it is DERIVED from the ``mount_data_plane`` / ``require_auth``
            knobs so behaviour is identical to before this parameter existed. When
            provided it is the single source for router-group mounting, auth, and
            data-plane lifespan gating (the legacy knobs still populate the derived
            profile, so callers may pass either — they express the same thing).
        durable_org_ids_provider: Optional zero-arg callable returning the org_ids
            with actionable durable-learning work, threaded straight through to
            ``maybe_start_durable_learning(org_ids_provider=...)``. When None
            (default) the single-ref bootstrap default is used, so behaviour is
            byte-identical to before this parameter existed. It is a plain
            injectable seam so a deployment (e.g. enterprise cross-ref fan-out) can
            supply its own discovery WITHOUT this factory importing deployment
            logic. It is only consulted when ``REFLEXIO_DURABLE_LEARNING_QUEUE`` is
